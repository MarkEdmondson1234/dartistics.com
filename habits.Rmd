Here are some good habits to get into learnt from experience to make working with R easier.

## Project structure

1. For every new task, client or project, create an RStudio project (top right)
2. Create a `script` and `data` folder in the project straight away
3. Put your R scripts `./scripts/your-script.R` in the script folder, and raw or processed data written to the data folder (`./data/your_data.csv`)
4. Never change your working directory in the scripts.

## Code style

1. Follow a code style - we suggest this one:
2. Be verbose but concise with your function and varaible names
3. Comment everything - you can even start with comments
4. Pretend the reader of your code is a homicidal maniac who will axe you if they don't understand it
5. Avoid copy-pasting, if you repeat yourself more than twice, write a function
6. Fail fast - use `stop()` to write informative error messages
7. Check the types of your input and output variables are what you expected

## Always check the type

1. 4 times out of 10 the errors in code is you copying something wrong `rowname` instead of `row.name` etc.
2. 4 times out of 10 the errors in code is expecting the wrong type e.g. `class(obj) == "list"` not `class(obj) == "data.frame"`
3. Use `str()` a lot.
