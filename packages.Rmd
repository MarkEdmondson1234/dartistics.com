```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

A large part of R's success is the ecosystem of open-sourced packages that add extra functionality to what R comes with, referre to as "base R".

## CRAN

CRAN is the official central repository for R packages, where human reviewed packages go through quality checks for publishing on the CRAN network around the world.  It is through CRAN that you install packages with the `install.package()` function, or via the Packages pane in the bottom left of RStudio.

## Github

There are also thousands of more experimental packages that are only available through Github.  These packages have come much easier to work with since the introduction of the package `devtools`, which via its function `install_github` means access to this universe.

Beware though that the packages on Github are by their nature more experimental, so due care should be excercised to ensure they are trustworthy.
