R itself comes with its own R Console, where you can write R commands and run programs, but it is highly recommended to also install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/home/), as it makes working with R a lot easier.

RStudio features 4 panes for common R tasks:

* Bottom left: The R console as you would see if launching normal R
* Top left: An editor for writing R scripts
* Top right: A helper pane for importing files, seeing R objects etc.
* Bottom right: File explorer, package list, Viewer

All the above are configurable.

## Using RStudio

It is recommended that the console is used as a scratchpad to test out R commands, but for most of your work to be carried out in the R script editor.  This not only gives good habits regarding reproduacability, but also means its easier to send your work to someone else.

RStudio are very active in the R community, and so have also launched several features such as RMarkdown, Shiny, and Addins that are all compatible with RStudio.

This website was created using a new RStudio RMarkdown feature, building websites out of RMarkdown files. 

## RStudio Server

RStudio is essentially a custom webbrowser, which means that it has almost the exact same interface on the desktop as its online server option, RStudio Server.  This runs in a browser, giving user's the same access to a configured server with say custom packages.
