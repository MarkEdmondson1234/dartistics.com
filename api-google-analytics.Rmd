There are several R packages for reaching the Google Analytics API, but the one we're describing here is `googleAnalyticsR`, as its the one the author wrote!  However you may prefer the syntax of one of the others, which are listed on the [`googleAnalyticsR` homepage](http://code.markedmondson.me/googleAnalyticsR/).

The example below generates a `web_data` object that is used in various exercises throughout this site. So, you may want to build a script based on the instructions on this page and save it for future use as you work through other examples and exercises.

## Installation

```{r}
## This installs googleAnalyticsR if you haven't got it already
if(!require(googleAnalyticsR)) install.packages("googleAnalyticsR")
```
## Authentication

By default you can authenticate using googleAnalyticsR default project:

```{r}
library(googleAnalyticsR)
ga_auth()
```

Pause here, as the first time it should open a web browser the first time to your Google login.

Sign in to give access for your session.  

This will create a `.httr-oauth` file in your working directory folder that contains your authentication details.  Keep this file safe as people could access your data if they have access to it.

## Getting your View Id

To get your data, you need to specify which Google Analytics View you want to pull it from.  

The easiest way to find this is to use `google_analytics_account_list()` to list your Views, then read the number in the `viewId` column:

```{r}
my_accounts <- google_analytics_account_list()
head(my_accounts)

## The account viewIds (since all columns is a little messy when displayed here)
head(my_accounts$viewId)
```

## Querying your data

You can then download your data via the [`v4 reporting API`](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v4/) with the `google_analytics_4()` function.  See `?google_analytics_4` and the website for complete details and examples.

```{r}
## change this to your own ViewId
## this one will only work if you have access to Mark's blog!
my_id <- 81416156 
web_data <- google_analytics_4(my_id, 
                                date_range = c("2016-01-01", "2016-08-01"),
                                metrics = c("sessions","users","pageviews",
                                            "entrances","bounces"),
                                dimensions = c("date","deviceCategory",
                                               "channelGrouping"))
head(web_data)
```
