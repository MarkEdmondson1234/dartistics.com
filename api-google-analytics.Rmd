```{r analytics-apis setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
source("dartistics_packages.R")

library(knitr)
library(googleAuthR)
options(googleAuthR.cache_package = "googleAnalyticsR")

```

There are several R packages for accessing the Google Analytics API, but the one we're describing here is `googleAnalyticsR`, as it's the one that one of the creators of this site created (and the co-creator of this site, as well as many, many users, have found to be fantastic)!  However, if you want to check out some of others, see the list on the `googleAnalyticsR` [home page](http://code.markedmondson.me/googleAnalyticsR/).

The example below generates a `web_data` object that is used in various exercises throughout this site. So, you may want to build a script based on the instructions on this page and save it for future use as you work through other examples and exercises.

## Installation

```r
# This installs googleAnalyticsR if you haven't got it installed already
if(!require(googleAnalyticsR)) install.packages("googleAnalyticsR")
```

## Authentication

By default you can authenticate using the `googleAnalyticsR` default project (we're not going to dive into the details of what this means at the moment -- it gets a little into the weeds of Google APIs and development):

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(googleAnalyticsR)
ga_auth()
```

Pause here, as, the first time you run the script, at least, it should open a web browser and require you allow access to your Google Analytics account. This is _just_ providing the script that you're running access to the data -- nothing broader than that:

<div style="text-align: center">
![](images/google_auth_login.png)
</div>

Sign in to give access for your session.  

This will create a `.httr-oauth` file in your working directory folder that contains your authentication details.  Keep this file safe as people could access your data if they have access to it.

## Getting your View ID

To get your data, you need to specify which Google Analytics View you want to pull it from. There are a couple of ways to do this.

### Option 1: Getting View IDs using R

The easiest way to find this is to use `google_analytics_account_list()` to list your Views, then read the number in the `viewId` column:

```{r eval=FALSE}

# Pull a full list of the views that you have access to
my_accounts <- ga_account_list()

```

Now, go to the **Environment** tab (top right pane in RStudio) and double-click **my_accounts**. Find the view you want to use and note the **viewId** value for it.

### Option 2: Getting View IDs with Query Explorer

Another way to get the view ID is to go to the [Google Analytics Query Explorer](https://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/query-explorer/), log in (if you're not already logged in), and select an account, property, and view. The view ID will be the value displayed in the **ids** field.

## Querying your data

Once you have a view ID, you use it to download your data via the [`v4 reporting API`](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v4/) with the `google_analytics_4()` function.  See `?google_analytics_4` and the website for complete details and examples.

```{r message=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Change this to your own view ID, as the one below will only work for accessing
# data from Mark Edmondson's blog, and it's highly unlikely you have access to that!
my_id <- 81416156 

# Now, query for some basic data, assigning the data to a 'data frame' object 
# called 'web_data'
web_data <- google_analytics_4(my_id, 
                                date_range = c("2016-01-01", "2016-08-01"),
                                metrics = c("sessions","pageviews",
                                            "entrances","bounces"),
                                dimensions = c("date","deviceCategory",
                                               "channelGrouping"),
                                anti_sample = TRUE)
```

Now, display the first few rows of the resulting data frame (or, you can double-click on **web_data** in the **Environment** pane):

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Display the first few rows of the data that was returned.
head(web_data)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(head(web_data))
```

Simple, right? This is a good opportunity to also check out the structure of a help file for a function. Type `?google_analytics_4` in the console and then read through the function documentation. You should notice that the example above only uses a handful of the options actually available in the function. But, you could stop here and play around with the actual query for a bit -- changing out the dimensions and metrics and date range are a good start.
