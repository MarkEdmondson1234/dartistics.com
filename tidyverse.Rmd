title: "Tidy data and the Tidyverse"
---

This section covers an important strategy when you are cleaning data, that is to aim to create **tidy data**, which is a defined concept of how data should look before you work with it.  This is a concept that is embraced by the godfather of R, Hadley Wickham, and so supported by his collection of packages, the so called **tidyverse**.

# Tidy data

There are a great many resources on tidy data that will explain it better than we can here, so we will just give it a brief summary and leave some links for further reading, but the main point is that we embrace its philosophy and as a data analyst it is wise to aim for tidy data after you have imported it.

## Tidy summary

> "Tidy datasets are all alike, but every messy dataset is messy in its own way" - Hadley Wickham

The aim of a tidy dataset is to present it in a manner that further processing can be done in an organised fashion:

1. Each variable in the data set is placed in its own column
2. Each observation is placed in its own row
3. Each value is placed in its own cell

Tidy data isn't necessarily data that is easiest to read by a human, but it is well suited for passing into further R functions, especially those within the `tidyverse`.

# Tidyverse

`Tidyverse` is the new name for the `Hadleyverse`, which is a collection of R packages created or supported by Hadley Wickham.

These packages aim to cover the whole spectrum of data analysis within R, each supporting the other in concepts and output.  The main packages within it are are:

* [`tibble`](https://github.com/hadley/tibble) - creating more user-friendly data.frames 
* [`dplyr`](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr) - data manipulation of data.frames
* [`ggplot2`](http://ggplot2.org/) - plotting tidy data
* [`tidyr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html) - tools to tidy data.frames
* [`purrr`](https://github.com/hadley/purrr) - more general data manipulation tools
* [`magrittr`](https://github.com/smbache/magrittr) - the origin of `%>%`, extensivly used in the tidyverse
* [`broom`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/broom/vignettes/broom.html) - turn statistical models into tidy data.frames/tiddles

This list is just a subset of the tidyverse packages, but, the tidyverse has grown so much in popularity that you can now simply install the ['tidyverse' package](https://blog.rstudio.org/2016/09/15/tidyverse-1-0-0/), which will install all of these packages (and a few more) all at once.

Whilst you can achieve what the above packages do in base R or with other packages (`data.table()` a noteable alternative to `dplyr()`), if you embrace the `tidyverse` then you will need to become familiar with some if not all the packages above.
