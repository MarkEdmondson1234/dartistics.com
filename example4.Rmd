```

This is a Shiny app made to test if an event has a statistically significant effect.

It connects to your Google Analytics data via an ancestor of `googleAnalyticsR`, displays it in a Shiny application styled with `shnydashboard`, applies Bayesian statistics using `CausalImpact` and then displays the results in an interactive HTMLwidget for time-series called `dygraphs`.

Try out the [Shiny App](https://gallery.shinyapps.io/ga-effect/) here.
