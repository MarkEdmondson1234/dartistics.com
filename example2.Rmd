title: "Example 2: Google Analytics Interactive Data Explorer"
---

```{r example2-setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This is an example of a "Shiny" application built with R -- a web-based application that allows the user to interact with the data directly. You can try it out at  [https://gilligan.shinyapps.io/ga-data-explorer/](https://gilligan.shinyapps.io/ga-data-explorer/).

![](images/example2_ga-explorer.png)

Some keys to the underlying functionality used to build this:

* The `googleAnalyticsR` package -- one of several packages available for pulling data from Google Analytics 
* The `shiny` package -- Shiny is a package that makes R scripts interactive and web-based.
* The `ggplot2` package -- the visualizations are all built using the plotting capabilities of ggplot2

## The Code

This code may look a bit intimidating. But, notice that much of the "code" is actually just comments explaining what the code is doing. So, even without fully following all aspects of the code, it is relatively easy for someone moderately familiary with R to take the code and tweak it here and there to suit their specific needs. 

```{r eval=FALSE}

#
# App to explore Google Analytics metrics across two dimensions. The user has to authenticate
# and choose a view.
#

library(shiny)              # We must web-enable this whole thing
library(googleAuthR)        # To prompt for authentication by the user
library(googleAnalyticsR)   # For the pulling of the data
library(tidyverse)          # For data transformations -- primarily just uses dplyr commands
library(scales)             # Cuz, ya' know, commas in displayed numbers

####################
# Set up the different options for interaction
####################

# DATE OPTIONS
# This could also be set as date selectors easily enough, but, for now, it's just set
# as some preset options. As a note, even though the values are being set as numerics 
# here, they actually get treated as characters, so they have to be converted 
# back to numerics when setting start_date in the get_data() function.
daterange_options <- list("Last 7 Days" = 7,
                          "Last 30 Days" = 30,

                          "Last 90 Days" = 90)

# METRIC OPTIONS
# As currently written, these can only be # summable metrics, as the data gets pulled
# once as daily data and # then gets aggregated (and would require much more 
# hoop-jumping to then do weighted averages to get 'rates' of any sort).

# Analytics API value.
